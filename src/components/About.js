        Hey there, I'm Roman. Developer, Tech lead and Product Manager. My first
        encounter with programming was in high school when I played around with
        HTML and CSS. I found my passion with tech and coding in University,
        where I learned about algorithms, touring machines and pointers. I
        remember when I was reading through the book "C/C++ textbook", when it
        clicked for me how cool and how much fun programming can be.
      </p>

        Later, after working a while as a software developer, I got the
        opportunity to lead a small team of developers as a product owner. I had
        no idea what I was getting into. While this would have been a
        challenging transition for any engineer, 2 out of 4 engineers in my team
        left the company before I started taking over the team and the number of
        bugs was in the low triple digits. With the help of a lot of great
        people around me, I managed to build a small and effective team that was
        able to deliver. I especially enjoyed mentoring other developers and
        working closely with the team to find amazing solutions to cool
        problems. Even today, I feel that the things I've learned there will
        benefit me for the rest of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I work as a tech lead and product manager, where I have the
        opportunity to combine my technical skills with my passion to lead.
