           Hey there, I'm Roman. Developer, Tech lead and Product Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into programming began high school, where I played around with
          HTML and CSS. Later, I found my passion with tech and coding in University,
          where I learned about algorithms, Touring machines and pointers. I still remember the moment it all clicked
          while reading a C/C++ book â€” realizing the endless possibilities of programming and how much fun it is.

          A few years into my career as a software engineer, I got the
          opportunity to lead a small team of developers as a product owner. I had
          no idea what I was getting into. While this would have been a
          challenging transition for any engineer, 2 out of 4 engineers in my team
          left the company before I started taking over the team and the number of
          bugs was in the triple digits. I was clearly out of my depth! But the team was fantastic, and I was
          surrounded by amazing people who supported me. Over time, we found our rhythm and started delivering.
          What stands out most from that period is how much I enjoyed mentoring other developers and
          working closely with the team to find amazing solutions to cool problems.
          Even today, I believe that the things I've learned there will benefit me for the rest of my life.

          Currently, I work as a tech lead and product manager,  combining my technical expertise with my passion for
          leadership. While my role now involves more strategic thinking, product management and meetings,
          I still enjoy building the occasional feature, fixing a bug or creating solutions for exciting problems.
